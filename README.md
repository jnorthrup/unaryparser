Off-heap memory tools placed in sun.misc.unreal
==============================================

Some tools to work with off-heap memory using `sun.misc.Unsafe` class. Contains fallback
implementations for environments, where proper implementation of `sun.misc.Unsafe` is not available.

All memory access code has boundary checks using [assert](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html) keyword.
With assertions enabled in runtime (`-ea` java switch) illegal memory access will throw `AssertionError`.
Without assertions illegal memory access will crash JVM.

Library has no third-party dependencies and is available in [Maven central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/alexkasko/):

Off-heap memory, data structures, operations
--------------------------------------------

JVM allows to allocate and use memory outside of java heap. Such off-heap memory may be allocated/used/deallocated
without additional load on garbage collector.

###Off-heap memory management

Off-heap memory manager implemented as a thin wrapper over `sun.misc.Unsafe`. Other data structures implemented on top of it.

See `com.alexkasko.unsafe.offheap` [package description](http://alexkasko.github.io/unsafe-tools/com/alexkasko/unsafe/offheap/package-summary.html)
for details.

###Off-heap collections of longs

Maximum array length in Java is bounded by `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This library provides long-sized fixed and growing arrays of longs.

See `com.alexkasko.unsafe.offheaplong` [package description](http://alexkasko.github.io/unsafe-tools/com/alexkasko/unsafe/offheaplong/package-summary.html)
for details.

###Off-heap collections of structs (memory areas)

Equal-sized memory areas may be stored in off-heap memory contiguously as collections. Such memory areas also may be used
like C structs (without compiler checks, though). Sorting and searching of these collections may be done using `long` or `int`
"fields" of such "structs" or using `Comparator`. Sorting also can be performed "by-references" using additional array to
 hold collections indices (without reordering elements in the collection itself).

See `com.alexkasko.unsafe.offheapstruct` [package description](http://alexkasko.github.io/unsafe-tools/com/alexkasko/unsafe/offheapstruct/package-summary.html)
for details.

###Operations

The following operations are implemented for all off-heap data structures:

 - Dual-Pivot Quicksort implementation, adapted from [here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/android-4.2.2_r1/luni/src/main/java/java/util/DualPivotQuicksort.java).
 - Binary Search implementation, adapted from [here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/android-4.2.2_r1/luni/src/main/java/java/util/Arrays.java).

Byte array tool
---------------

`sun.misc.Unsafe` may be used for writing/reading primitive values to/from byte arrays and to copying memory between byte arrays.
Byte array tool is implemented on top of it.

See `com.alexkasko.unsafe.bytearray` [package description](http://alexkasko.github.io/unsafe-tools/com/alexkasko/unsafe/bytearray/package-summary.html)
for details.
